e2e Testing
-----------

This specific project uses [WebdriverIO](http://webdriver.io/) for e2e testing.

End-to-end tests are kept in the `./e2e/specs/` directory

In order to run the tests you will need to first start the e2e testing server:

```bash
npm run e2eServer;
```

Next you can run the tests:

```bash
npm run e2e;
```

All screenshots of UI error messages generated by running the tests can be found in the `./e2e/errorShots` directory.

See the `wdio.conf.js` file or the [documentation](http://webdriver.io/) for more options.
